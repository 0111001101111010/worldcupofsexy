World Cup of Sexy
==============

Who's the hottest player in the World Cup 2014? YOU DECIDE! 

You'll start off with 32 randomly selected players (from over 700 on the FIFA site!) Click whichever one you think is hotter. Keep playing until you reach the final round and one player is chosen as the hottest, then share your pick with your friends on Facebook for the world to see! Keep playing more rounds to see other sets of players and check out the global ranking of the top-scoring players overall! 

---------------

This is still in development and I would love it if you could help!   
   
Here are the next steps:   
1) generate 32 random numbers in range 0 to 731  
2) get 32 players from those random numbers (by ID)  
3) display player image, name, country, and flag inside the "cards"    
4) allow user to click through them tournament style and (in JSON) keep track of who wins and loses each round    
5) change round number to fit tournament round (below "cards" on the screen)   
6) let user share final winning player image & name w/ website    
7) let user play another round with 32 other random players   

8) store players in database so there can be global ranking (players accrue 1 point for winning in round 1 or 2, 2 points for winning in quarterfinals or semifinals, and 3 points for winning overall. therefore winner of one bracket will get a total of 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 9 points)
